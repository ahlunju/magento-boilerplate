This is where you will paste your compiled minified CSS styles from the LESS precompiler. Some precompilers will
automatically update this file so you may not need to paste anything here.

There are numerous precompilers out there I personally use WinLess (http://winless.org/)
Once installed if you add the folder fisheye > default it will automatically use the CSS folder as the output folder. 
The template hierarchy should be as follows:

skin > frontend > mypackagename > default           (add this folder to the Winless gui)
skin > frontend > mypackagename > default > less    (put all your .less files in here)
skin > frontend > mypackagename > default > css     (WinLess will automatically compile your .less files into a file called styles.css)
